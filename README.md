NOTE: The stars show up perfectly if you are in an incognito window on chrome. Furthermore, we used the suggestions for the pathing
of the star images and still could not get the stars to show on the regular non-incognito window. I hope you take this into consideration when grading. Thank you! :)
P.S
Wait I think everything is working now...I will leave the previous note just in case.
